Push al lpaths form the point on which tototu are astanding on a stack;. WHile the stack is not empty, pop a path from the stack, and follow the path until you reach an exit, intersction, or dead end. If you found an exit---> congratulations!
Else if you found an intersection, you push all the paths meeting at the intersectom except the current one, onto the stakc. 

edge cases- no cycles int eh maze, (i/c you never circle back to a previously visisted intersectoion )
